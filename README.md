Hey there! I'm a goal-oriented front-end web developer who loves to collaborate and create functional website user interfaces (UIs) that perform well in search engine rankings. I have experience working with Javascript, React.js, HTML, CSS, Figma, and Tailwind, which are essential tools for building modern, responsive websites with beautiful user interfaces.

In addition to my current skills, I'm always eager to learn new things. That's why I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge of Typescript, Node.js, and Next.js. These skills will help me build more complex and scalable web applications.

As a front-end web developer, I believe it's important to stay curious and continuously learn new skills and technologies. I enjoy being part of online communities and attending local meetups to network with other developers and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
