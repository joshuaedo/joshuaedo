Hey there! 

I'm a front-end web developer who loves to collaborate and create functional website user interfaces (UIs) that perform well in search engine rankings. I have experience working with Javascript, React.js, HTML, CSS, Figma, and Tailwind.

In addition to my current skills, I'm always eager to learn new things. That's why I'm currently focused on expanding my knowledge of Typescript, Node.js, and Next.js.
